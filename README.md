This code performs a comprehensive analysis of HR dataset data by following these main steps:

1. Loading and Preprocessing: 
   - Data is imported from a CSV file.  
   - Missing values are handled and date columns are converted.  
   - Derived variables are calculated, such as age, experience, and numeric performance score.

2. Additional Transformations:
   - Dummy encoding is applied to categorical variables to transform them into numeric formats.  
   - Additional columns are generated to facilitate further analyses (e.g., gender encoding).

3. Descriptive Analysis and Visualizations: 
   - Descriptive statistics (means, medians, quartiles) are displayed, and graphs (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots) are built to explore salary distribution, the relationship between absences and salary, demographic distribution, etc.

4. Analysis Functions:
   - The code defines several functions to analyze different aspects, such as demographics, salary performance, career progression, training, turnover, recruitment sources, employee satisfaction, salary differences by gender, and remuneration policies.  
   - Specific visualizations are generated for each area of interest.

5. Regression Analysis and Feature Selection: 
   - A linear regression model is implemented to predict salary.  
   - Feature importance is calculated, variable selection is performed (using ANOVA and Mutual Information), and multicollinearity issues are evaluated using VIF.  
   - The performance of multiple models (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, and OLS) is compared using GridSearchCV, and metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² are reported.
